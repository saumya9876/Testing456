		          <h2><i>Co-Founder</i></h2>
		          <p>I am a junior attending Lynbrook High School. I love to code in Java, Python, and other languages. I am very passionate about programming, and I take a lot of interest in artificial inteligence and machine learning. My passion for teaching other children and sharing my knowledge was first ignited when I was very young. Since an early age, I have always enjoyed teaching my little sister new subjects that I had learned. In my freshman year, I was able to take my passion to the next level by instructing elementary school students different topics related to science and technology. Through ChiCode, I hope to be able to reach out to more people across the world and present them with the opportunity to learn programming with the help of online courses. I am thrilled to be one of the co-founders at ChiCode, and I am looking forward to making an impact through my contribution.

		          <h2><i>Co-Founder</i></h2>
		          <p>My vision in cofounding ChiCode is to allow children and young adults to gain access to computer literacy. This idea was first born when I visited an orphanage in developing country while in elementary school and noticed that many children don’t have access to basic computer literacy. Later in middle school, I revisited the orphanage after hosting a fundraiser to donate laptops and taught the children basic computer literacy. During my freshman year, I founded A-Z Hacks, a non profit organization and hosted a 100 hacker plus hackathon in partnership with Women in Tech at LinkedIn in an effort to promote girls interest in technology. During COVID 19 pandemic, I want to continue my efforts to help children and young adults to learn/improve their computer skills safely by providing them access to online computer courses. Creating online courses is my humble effort to use my passion for Computer Science to make computer literacy accessible to aspiring students.
